 <p class="explanation"> According to the data The University of Pittsburgh leads all schools in coach payroll</p>



  <div class="Story">
    <p> When discussing the Athletic Coast Conference (ACC), athletics, and success, does having a bigger coach payroll, and having school history correlate with winning? NIL has completely changed the landscape of college sports and as we can see from the data, there are four basic categories the schools can be broken up into in this era. The first one is the higher payroll schools, The University of Pittsburgh and the University of Clemson outrank the rest of their ACC opponents when it comes to men’s and women’s athletic Head Coach salaries. Our second category is the lower payroll schools, we see Boston College and Duke University at the bottom for both men’s and women’s. Then the third category, the middle of the pack schools, with nine universities and colleges clumped together in the middle, and finally, the middle to low category, which is the five schools above Duke and Boston College. Through the four categories, the entire realm of the ACC is pretty close when it comes to coaches' salaries.  
</p>

<p> 
There are some outliers, the newcomers to the ACC: SMU, Stanford, and Cal which are in the  too early to tell stage. </p>

<p>When we think about some of the best ACC athletic schools in recent years, schools such as Clemson, Duke, UNC, and Miami come to mind, which is fairly interesting because the four schools are spread out into each of the categories listed above. Clemson University has recently competed in national championships in Football and Men’s Soccer, they have also expanded their female sports programs with new facilities. They have taken the pay a higher amount route, the nicer the facilities, the better the treatment for the players, and the more the coaches are paid the better the coaches are, the better chances they feel they have at competing in every sport. Duke on the other hand has competed at a high level in both Men’s and Women’s Basketball, they had 4 female all-Americans on their soccer team this year, and they lead the entire nation with student-athletes on the honor roll at 620 student-athletes. Duke, has chosen to take the hard work, put their head down, and stay focused mentality to build winning programs within their University. Schools like Miami take a similar approach to Clemson, just with a lower coaches payroll, while UNC correlates more with Duke, just with a slightly higher coaches payroll. So it’s either go all in on high payroll or low payroll, or find a medium, but if you’re in the medium range you should make sure to differentiate if your school is a low medium or a high medium. Being a medium such as Wake Forest or North Carolina State is common with not as much success athletically. 
</p>

<p>All four categories have proved their positives and negatives, but most importantly they have all proved that there isn’t necessarily one way you need to spend your money to create a winning program. Coaches may not be the focal point in payroll for some schools like Notre Dame, but the historical success is there and the appeal that there is one Notre Dame in the world is still a compelling offer. Florida State, North Carolina State, Virginia, and Virginia Tech are those middle schools that may not have the historical appeal. One could argue Virginia does, but out of the other schools they are in that middle area, as stated above is the area not to be in. In a moment of truth for these Universities, the identity of how they want the future of their athletics to shape out will have to be decided, are they going to take the medium route of paying their coaches a little bit more and hoping for a Miami situation or are they going to reroute those funds and pay their coaches a smaller amount, like UNC. The biggest factors in deciding which route your school should take, a few things to consider are, how many coaches total make up each male and female program, and how many actual students are on campus. Is there a surplus need of money elsewhere because the school is larger? And how much more money than you aren’t currently spending on coaches are you willing to spend on coaches? For certain schools, the answer might be easier said than done, and that might be the case with our very own Syracuse University.

<p class="Dos"> Syracuse can be seen here in comparison with Duke and Clemson, revealing an answer for the Orange </p>


<div class="Words">
  <p> Syracuse University is an interesting spot, they are towards the top of the ACC when it comes to money spent on coaches, yet they are closer to the bottom of the ACC when it comes to coaches that are employed. A local Syracuse reporter, Connor Pignatello, feels as though Syracuse has to make a move now. According to Pignatello, a conference realignment, like the one we saw last year, is inevitable for college sports, and when it does happen again, Syracuse might have an opportunity to leave the ACC. If they are able to follow a similar path as Clemson, spending more money on coaches and athletics in general, Pignatello thinks the Orange will be set up to get a bigger revenue share of TV deals and be able to spend more money on coaches without having to worry about revenue turnover. Syracuse doesn’t have the academic brand like Duke does, that’s one of the reasons Duke is able to succeed, Syracuse relates more to a school like Clemson, not just in style, but in numbers.</p>

<p>Pignatello continued to make the point that Syracuse University needs to continue to forge its own identity, a problem that a lot of schools have is that they want to follow a path of success, but they don’t know how to make it their own. It’s one of the main reasons Duke is able to pay their coaches the least amount of money, while still having one of the highest numbers of employed coaches in the country. Syracuse had its identity for 30+ years in men’s basketball coach Jim Boeheim, in the years since his retirement Syracuse has yet to fill the void of a true identity. If a clear statement from the University can be made that they want to put more money into their athletic coaches and spend the time to make the number of coaches employed higher, the Orange could be on its way to an identity, and its own path of how to have winning athletic programs. </p>
